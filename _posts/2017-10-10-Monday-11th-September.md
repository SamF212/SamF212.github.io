This was in fact our first I.T of the year as on our first week back, we did not come to school until wednesday which was really nice! However, we're back for good now and it’s time for us to knuckle down a little bit and get down to some hardcore I.T. Or is it computer science? Computing? AGH it’s insane! Anyway, I’m going to stick to I.T for this as it is much easier to type so sorry sir if i’m wrong!

Anyway, our topic for this half of the Autumn Term is how to use google sheets to it's full potential. Many big businesses use Google Sheets to organise different things in their place of work. 

As it is our first lesson, we were only doing a sort of test/practise lesson just to get us used to some of the most basic but most used functions on sheets. These include - SUM (adding all the numbers in the selected cells together), PRODUCT (multiplying all the numbers in the selected cells), COUNT (telling you the number of cells that have been selected) and AVERAGE (obviously; finding the average of the numbers in the selected cells) .

After introductions and talking that you get on the first lesson back, that's all we managed to get done in that lesson so I guess I’ll see ya’ll next week!
