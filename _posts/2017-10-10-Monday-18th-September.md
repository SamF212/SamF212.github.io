Monday was our second lesson back for I.T and we started to look a little further into what we could do with google sheets. Sir decided that we were going to act as a company who was trying to sell their stock, as companies do, and we were going to use google sheets to find the easiest route of doing so, as sir says 'work smarter not harder'. This lesson wasnâ€™t really much new stuff. 

We created a table with an item code, item name, quantity stock, buy price and sell price. We called it our stock list. We could put anything (non explicit) that we wanted into our table and give it a cost price and sell price. That took a surprisingly long time and we only had time for one more thing at the end of the lesson. We changed the colour of the cells that we either had too little or too much of so we knew whether to buy more stock or stop buying that particular item as much as it was not celling. It was an interesting, fun lesson.
