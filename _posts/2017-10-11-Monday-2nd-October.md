Back again first lesson on Monday for an I.T lesson. Brilliant. As you know, we're looking at google sheets and how we  can use them to our advantage in our later life. 

Last lesson we created our stock list and listed how much each product costed and how much we would sell it for. Today, we created an order form. Today was an easy lesson as all we did was pretty much take the first few items on our stock list and create a new sheet named 'Order Form' so we could use it instead of the stock list. Again, this took up a good chunk of the lesson but Sir had more for us to do - an introduction to next lesson.

We were told that next lesson, we were going to look at discounts and how we can use specific formulas to easily use our own made up discount codes to take a certain percentage off our original price. I have to say, I'm intrigued.
